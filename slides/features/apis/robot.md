## Robot

The main way you tell Hubot what to do

 * `robot.hear` <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 * `robot.respond` <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 * `robot.messageChannel` <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 * `robot.http` <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:

There are many more APIs you can use.

Hubot is built around expressjs so you can actually expand how routing works
there are more details in the docs
